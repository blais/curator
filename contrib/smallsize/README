This is a patch sent on 2004-12-27 by Jan Vroonhof <jan.vroonhof at ntlworld.com>
I thought this could be helpful to others.
I won't apply it just yet, I want to only work on the new curator and leave
the current one untouched (don't want to spend time on it).

Hi Martin,

I have been meaning to sent this for a while. Thanks a lot for
curator.  I have been using to put pictures of my son on his
website. However as my family kept pestering me to have the pictures
resized to "screen size" for easier viewing (you must get the same), I have implemented that.

The patch is attached. It isn't really pretty but I thought I would
share it anyway.

Again thanks a lot for this great little program and happy new year.

Jan
