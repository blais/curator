curator</h1></center>
Curator is a powerful script that allows one to generate Web page image
galleries with the intent of displaying photographic images on the Web,
or for a CD-ROM presentation and archiving.
<p>It generates static Web pages only - no special configuration or running
scripts are required on the server. The script supports many file formats,
hierarchical directories, thumbnail generation and update, per-image description
file with any attributes, and 'tracks' of images spanning multiple directories.
The templates consist of HTML with embedded Python. Running this script
only requires a recent Python interpreter and the ImageMagick tools. If
you've been looking for a simple yet very powerful script to do this task
you've come to the right place.
<p>This package consists in a single Python script file. Download and run
(you'll need Python 2 or more and ImageMagick). It is released under the
GNU General Public License.

<h3>
Features</h3>
This script was written with the following requirements/goals/features:
<ul>
<li>
on the client side: nothing more should be required than a <b>web browser</b>
to use it;</li>

<li>
on the server side: the web pages should be <b>statically</b> generated
(no need for special server configuration, no cgi, no PHP, no Zope, no
nonsense, just HTML);</li>

<li>
all links are <b>relative links</b> (i.e. it should work when burned on
a CDROM or moved);</li>

<li>
the output HTML should be <b>templated/themeable</b> (i.e. the user can
change the look of the output HTML). In fact, the templates themselves
are written with embedded Python code in the HTML, the possibilities are
endless;</li>

<li>
each photograph can have arbitrary attributes associated to it, in a <b>per-image
attributes file</b>. The script simply makes these available to the template
code to take advantage of. For example, this is how you can include photo
description, EXIF camera settings, or any other user-define attribute (just
write a template that uses those);</li>

<li>
<b>thumbnails</b> should be generated automatically, the thumbnails reside
alongside the photos themselves;</li>

<li>
&nbsp;can be created to fill in variables in the templates (e.g. title,
description, camera settings, other);</li>

<li>
<b>tracks</b> of images, independent (and across) of directories can be
generated using the attributes file. The script compiles these list of
images and they're available to the templates. This could be used, for
example, to links are your "people", or "black and white" images together,
each photograph can be part of one or more tracks;</li>

<li>
a <b>global</b>, <b>per-track</b> and <b>per-directory</b> index page should
be generated;</li>

<li>
it should be <b>simple to use</b> (it should be able to work with a simple
hierarchy of image files, with a trivial invocation, try it now, if it
don't work, I've failed);</li>

<li>
we're not assuming that the names of the files are unique across the hierarchy
(for digital camera images);</li>

<li>
supports <b>many file formats</b>;</li>

<li>
it should be <b>trivial to install, and portable</b> (i.e. should not use
more than what is available in base installs of most linux distributions).
In this respect, thus this script only depends on the availability of:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Python, version 2 or more;</li>

<li>
ImageMagick tools;</li>
</ul>
There is no special library to install, no special tools, nothing. Download
and run. This runs on a default redhat install. There is a switch for supporting
old versions of the ImageMagick tools.</ul>

<h3>
Why?</h3>
There are many other worthy similar systems on the web. It seems everyone
and their sister has been writing an image gallery generation script these
days. Why did I write my own, mind you ask? Most of the existing ones required
server customizations (PHP, cgi scripts) and thus will not work off of
an archive CDROM, or required some annoying installation of some special
image manipulation packages, or didn't support templating. Besides, I really
wanted the <i>tracks</i> feature, and when I started diddling a prototype
for the embedded Python execution within the template HTML, I thought it
was so cool, I just had to do it.
<p>Another way to view the services that this script provides is this:
<ul>
<li>
it gathers a per-directory, per-track, and global index of a hierarchy
of files;</li>

<li>
templates for each file, directory, track, all, are processed with embedded
python code in the template running in a specialized environment for the
page to generate, including access to the per-file attributes;</li>

<li>
it knows about some image-specific stuff (thumbnails, alternate representations)</li>
</ul>
You could probably easily retarget it to some other application (e.g. viewing
hierarchies of animations, text files, mp3's, etc.).
<p>(I have to mention that the closest I've come to not writing the script
myself and deciding on using someone else's was when I tried <a href="http://www.bb-zone.com/zope/bbzone">bbgallery</a>,
which is one of the few nice scripts out there that you can just download
and run without running around a thousand web sites to install the world
on your machine.)
<h3>
Portability</h3>
curator will run under any platform that has a Python2 (or more) interpreter
and the ImageMagick tools. It has been tested under Linux, IRIX and Windows2000
(download and unzip binaries from ImageMagick web site and use the --magick-path
option to specify location the tools).
<h3>
Documentation</h3>
Running the script with the default templates should be as easy as cd'ing
in the root of the image hierarchy and typing <tt>curator</tt>.
<p>Run <tt>curator --help</tt> for command line interface options, description
of the required inputs and of what the script generates.
<p>Run <tt>curator --help-script</tt> for a description of the scripting
environment API. It should be quite simple, really. Grab one of the example
templates above and modify them. Or use the <tt>--save-templates</tt> option
and modify the default templates.
