   Instructions for using Curator under a Windows platform.


Installing Prerequisites
------------------------

Install Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Get python self-install executable:
   http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.3/Python-2.3.exe

2. Run it, it will start an installer.  Notice the location where it puts it.


Install the PIL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python Imaging Library is what is used to convert the files.

1. Get pre-built binaries from:
   http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

   (the pre-built PIL for 2.3b will work for version 2.3)

2. Run the downloaded install program.

3. Make sure that you install it for your Python install.  The detection should
   do it automatically for you.

   Note: I have noticed that I could not edit the destination location when
   installing the files with the Windows installer.  So I installed it anyway
   and copied the files by hand under the ``Python23/Libs/site-packages/PIL``
   subdirectory, and it works well.


Install Curator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Get it from
   http://curator.sourceforge.net/

2. Uncompress the files::

      cd "c:/Program Files"
      tar zxf c:/tmp/curator-<ver>.tar.gz

   Note that you need some kind of tar tools (Cygwin has one) to unzip the files
   here.  I should provide zipped code at some point.  This only runs from a
   shell, so I'm assuming you already have installed Cygwin or MKS tools.


Running It
----------

Like this::

  C:/Python/python.exe C:/Program\ Files/curator/bin/curator --pil

I suggest using the ``--out-onedir`` option to avoid cluttering the input
directory.  The output files should be located under a new ``html`` directory.
