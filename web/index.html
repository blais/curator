<h1>xxdiff Homepage Moved</h1>

<p>
The official homepage for xxdiff is
now <b><a href="http://furius.ca/xxdiff">http://furius.ca/xxdiff</a></b>.
You should be redirected in 8 seconds.  If you are not redirected
automatically, click on the link above.

I--the author, Martin Blais--was getting annoyed with maintaining two web
pages up-to-date at the same time and therefore I have decided to
rationalize all my projects on my own server, where everything gets
updated automatically due to some scripting wizardry.  Don't worry, this
project is still alive and kicking (and it's mature and stable).
</p>

<p>
If my server is down momentarily, you can always view
a <b><a href="local/index.html">copy of the possibly outdated pages at
SourceForge</a></b>.
