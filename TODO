* super nice idea from fxt:

  make it able to create custom slide shows with a list of pictures in a certain
  order

  input a text file with the pictures in the desired order

* bug: if only --browse is available, curator doesn't pick them up anymore
  (e.g. use package_pics and try just running curator in the given subdir)

* curator --out-onedir picks up its own html output directory when run twice in
  a row.

* update the Debian man file curator.sgml (fetch from the web).

* something that is really annoying is that new directories are not stored in
  order of date in the directory index, find a solution for that.

 - for tracks, make curator able to use the basenames without the directories
   for the picture names

BIG BUG!  no-html is not the opposite of force-html, but they're implemented the same, do this!

 - implement lowsrc in images using thumbnails as a source (tdemarge)

 - write a script to copy the exif info from one jpeg file to another

 - write a script to extract thumbnails from jpegs which have them, this should
   make generating thumbnails much faster

 - include "source: " field for archival retrieval

 - instructions for making a CDROM under windows on web page

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# long term
#

 - table generator: align image to top of cells, not center (vertically)

 - global definitions file to be executed for each environment for all templates

# merge getprop() and getattr() ?

Eventually:

 - the images don't necessarily reside where the HTML pages are, and can be
   scattered/organized over many different directories;

 - implement user-specified conversins


# add 'next directory' functionality to script env

# running surrogate programs, grab errors and print to stderr of this.
# e.g. convert program

# add reporting line or error in template

# try accessing Image class... it works... but it shouldn't what can we do about
# it?

# --urls mode
#   - only a global file, thumbnails generated locally
#   - dependency on wget
#   - look for desc file at URL location, then locally

# support generating an HTML global index with a list of URLs away from output
# dir. Should generate global index and image pages only. This would be a
# special mode.

# perhaps vars( class(envir) ) would solve the ugly hack for methods otherwise
# we could bin by hand

# allow placing thumbnails in an arbitrary directory.

# you'll want to support adding a copyright to individual images, and other
# types of conversions, processing

# implement <convert> field to automatically make conversions (optional) the
# code should be the same as thumbnails, the thumbnails is only a particular
# case of this.

Commands:

for f in `find . -name \*.jpg ! -name \*thumb* `; do echo $f ; j=`echo $f | sed -e 's/jpg/desc/'`; echo "settings:" > $j ;  ~/curator/exif995.py $f  >>   $j ; done




------------------------------

Currently the following files are produces:

 in root directory:
 allindex.html
 sortindex.html
 trackindes.html

 in every directory including root:
 dirindex.html
 image.html

 It is good practice to have an index.html in each 
directory, to give the web server a default file to 
display. True, one could change the web server 
default to "allindex.html, dirindex.html", but only 
if you run your own web server.

 With this in mind, it would be nice if there were an 
option to tell curator the following:
 - name the dirindex.html file in all none root
 directories 'index.html'
 - name the allindex.html file 'index.html'
 or
 name the sortindex.hml file 'index.hml'
 or
 name the trackindex.hml file 'index.hml'
 or
 name the dirindex.hml file in the root
 directory 'index.hml'

 References from the templates to the files should 
take this into account and point to the right file, 
of course.

 Maybe I am the only one who ran into this problem, 
maybe not.

 Hope you like the idea.

 Thomas
