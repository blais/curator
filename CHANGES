Version 2.1
-----------

* Moved image program support to the PIL. We will still support Imagemagick
  for a while, but I think soon we'll clean this up and the default will
  become the PIL.  This was motivated by making it work under Windows.
* Quickly ported some stuff to Python-2.3.

* Created packages using Python distutils.  The code hasn't changed apart from
  fixing the output of the version number.

  world. Groar!

Version 1.9
-----------

* Added FCache support for faster testing (copied all the code).

  under a single directory for an entire hierarchy. This allows much cleaner
  output.
