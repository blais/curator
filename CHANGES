# long term
#

# merge getprop() and getattr() ?

Eventually:

 - the images don't necessarily reside where the HTML pages are, and can be
   scattered/organized over many different directories;

 - implement user-specified conversins


# add 'next directory' functionality to script env

# running surrogate programs, grab errors and print to stderr of this.
# e.g. convert program

# add reporting line or error in template

# try accessing Image class... it works... but it shouldn't what can we do about
# it?

# --urls mode
#   - only a global file, thumbnails generated locally
#   - dependency on wget
#   - look for desc file at URL location, then locally

# support generating an HTML global index with a list of URLs away from output
# dir. Should generate global index and image pages only. This would be a
# special mode.

# perhaps vars( class(envir) ) would solve the ugly hack for methods otherwise
# we could bin by hand

# allow placing thumbnails in an arbitrary directory.

# you'll want to support adding a copyright to individual images, and other
# types of conversions, processing

# implement <convert> field to automatically make conversions (optional) the
# code should be the same as thumbnails, the thumbnails is only a particular
# case of this.
