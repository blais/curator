Current development version:

------------------------------
Version 1.0.2:

   * Fixed bug with images not being in sorted order (was using map order).
   * Fixed bug with multi-part images, now thumbnails are taken from [1].
     Should I make it configurable?
   * Changed fallback template so slightly (better navigation).
   * Fixed empty subdirectories bug.

------------------------------
Version 1.0.1:

   * Very very minor bug fixes.
   * Bug fix for EXIF JPEG's, that were not recognized by Python's imghdr.

------------------------------
Version 1.0:

   * Release.
   * Crazy weekend obsessively spitting code like a moron, plus two weeks
     stabilizing.


#===============================================================================
# TODO, COMMENTS, ETC, Wishlist/ToDo todo TODO list
#===============================================================================

 - publish my exif995.py script
   - finish it using the nikon-specific information, canon info also
   - make it independent of the camera
   - make it nicer, but don't use distutils.fancy_getopt

 - write a script to copy the exif info from one jpeg file to another

 - write a script to extract thumbnails from jpegs which have them, this should
   make generating thumbnails much faster

 - publish all these python scripts together somehow, probably not another
   project.  contact exit-tools author, and exifdump.py author

 - change annotate_image default to use 'display', with a scalae factor

 - implement a 'clean' option to curator, to instruct it to remove generated
   files.

 - add --no-html option for --force-html

 - add affinity for one type of image or another

 - publish all tools, describe workflow


blais template:

 - make thumbs global list of images

 - extract exif automatically if present in image

 - change font fo settings, doesn't work under linux (make less restrictive)

 - include "source: " field for archival retrieval

 - perhaps display one specific alt repn in the image square,
   instead of the main one


my tools:

 - extract date and generate "new" section on main page




#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# long term
#

 - global definitions file to be executed for each environment for all templates

# merge getprop() and getattr() ?

Eventually:

 - the images don't necessarily reside where the HTML pages are, and can be
   scattered/organized over many different directories;

 - implement user-specified conversins


# add 'next directory' functionality to script env

# running surrogate programs, grab errors and print to stderr of this.
# e.g. convert program

# add reporting line or error in template

# try accessing Image class... it works... but it shouldn't what can we do about
# it?

# --urls mode
#   - only a global file, thumbnails generated locally
#   - dependency on wget
#   - look for desc file at URL location, then locally

# support generating an HTML global index with a list of URLs away from output
# dir. Should generate global index and image pages only. This would be a
# special mode.

# perhaps vars( class(envir) ) would solve the ugly hack for methods otherwise
# we could bin by hand

# allow placing thumbnails in an arbitrary directory.

# you'll want to support adding a copyright to individual images, and other
# types of conversions, processing

# implement <convert> field to automatically make conversions (optional) the
# code should be the same as thumbnails, the thumbnails is only a particular
# case of this.

Commands:

for f in `find . -name \*.jpg ! -name \*thumb* `; do echo $f ; j=`echo $f | sed -e 's/jpg/desc/'`; echo "settings:" > $j ;  ~/curator/exif995.py $f  >>   $j ; done
