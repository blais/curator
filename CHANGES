Version 2.1
-----------

* Moved image program support to the PIL. We will still support Imagemagick
  for a while, but I think soon we'll clean this up and the default will
  become the PIL.  This was motivated by making it work under Windows.
* Quickly ported some stuff to Python-2.3.
  

Version 2.0.1
---------------------

* Created packages using Python distutils.  The code hasn't changed apart from
  fixing the output of the version number.


Version 2.0
------------------------------

* Released, it has been working for me for a while.
* Added CSS and will be testing it for a while before unleashing it to the
  world. Groar!

Version 1.9
------------------------------

* Fixed bug with altrepns paths.
* Added FCache support for faster testing (copied all the code).
* Added options to generate either in subdirectories of the directories or
  under a single directory for an entire hierarchy. This allows much cleaner
  output.
* Major cleanup, removed stupid environments, bettered templates.
* Removed a lot of silly options.

Version 1.3
------------------------------

Version 1.0.2
------------------------------

  Should I make it configurable?

  stabilizing.
