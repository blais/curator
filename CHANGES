Version 1.9
------------------------------

   * Fixed bug with altrepns paths.
   * Added FCache support for faster testing (copied all the code).
   * Added options to generate either in subdirectories of the directories or
     under a single directory for an entire hierarchy. This allows much cleaner
     output.
   * Major cleanup, removed stupid environments, bettered templates.
   * Removed a lot of silly options.

Version 1.3
------------------------------

   * Applied patch from Dave Baker for HTML compatibility.
   * More validating HTML output to HTML 4.0 myself.

Version 1.2
------------------------------

   * Added sorted index and templates.
   * Fixed bug with linkImage().

Version 1.1
------------------------------

   * Added global rc file support.
   * Added quote()/unquote() to common environment.
   * Fixed bug with filenames with spaces (in default templates too).
   * Fixed --force and --no bug.
   * Support for specifying affinity
   * (Internal) removed '--' in altrepns directly in Image()
   * (Internal) now treating Image._thumb and Image._attr more similarly
   * (Internal) cleaned up thumbnail filename mess
   * (Internal) cleaned up thumbnail filename mess

Version 1.0.2
------------------------------

   * Fixed bug with images not being in sorted order (was using map order).
   * Fixed bug with multi-part images, now thumbnails are taken from [1].
     Should I make it configurable?
   * Changed fallback template so slightly (better navigation).
   * Fixed empty subdirectories bug.

Version 1.0.1
------------------------------

   * Very very minor bug fixes.
   * Bug fix for EXIF JPEG's, that were not recognized by Python's imghdr.

Version 1.0
------------------------------

   * Release.
   * Crazy weekend obsessively spitting code like a moron, plus two weeks
     stabilizing.


#===============================================================================
# TODO, COMMENTS, ETC, Wishlist/ToDo todo TODO list
#===============================================================================

 - for tracks, make curator able to use the basenames without the directories
   for the picture names

BIG BUG!  no-html is not the opposite of force-html, but they're implemented the same, do this!

 - implement lowsrc in images using thumbnails as a source (tdemarge)

 - write a script to copy the exif info from one jpeg file to another

 - write a script to extract thumbnails from jpegs which have them, this should
   make generating thumbnails much faster

 - include "source: " field for archival retrieval

 - instructions for making a CDROM under windows on web page

personal:

 - insure camera ffs

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# long term
#

 - table generator: align image to top of cells, not center (vertically)

 - global definitions file to be executed for each environment for all templates

# merge getprop() and getattr() ?

Eventually:

 - the images don't necessarily reside where the HTML pages are, and can be
   scattered/organized over many different directories;

 - implement user-specified conversins


# add 'next directory' functionality to script env

# running surrogate programs, grab errors and print to stderr of this.
# e.g. convert program

# add reporting line or error in template

# try accessing Image class... it works... but it shouldn't what can we do about
# it?

# --urls mode
#   - only a global file, thumbnails generated locally
#   - dependency on wget
#   - look for desc file at URL location, then locally

# support generating an HTML global index with a list of URLs away from output
# dir. Should generate global index and image pages only. This would be a
# special mode.

# perhaps vars( class(envir) ) would solve the ugly hack for methods otherwise
# we could bin by hand

# allow placing thumbnails in an arbitrary directory.

# you'll want to support adding a copyright to individual images, and other
# types of conversions, processing

# implement <convert> field to automatically make conversions (optional) the
# code should be the same as thumbnails, the thumbnails is only a particular
# case of this.

Commands:

for f in `find . -name \*.jpg ! -name \*thumb* `; do echo $f ; j=`echo $f | sed -e 's/jpg/desc/'`; echo "settings:" > $j ;  ~/curator/exif995.py $f  >>   $j ; done




------------------------------

Currently the following files are produces:

 in root directory:
 allindex.html
 sortindex.html
 trackindes.html

 in every directory including root:
 dirindex.html
 image.html

 It is good practice to have an index.html in each 
directory, to give the web server a default file to 
display. True, one could change the web server 
default to "allindex.html, dirindex.html", but only 
if you run your own web server.

 With this in mind, it would be nice if there were an 
option to tell curator the following:
 - name the dirindex.html file in all none root
 directories 'index.html'
 - name the allindex.html file 'index.html'
 or
 name the sortindex.hml file 'index.hml'
 or
 name the trackindex.hml file 'index.hml'
 or
 name the dirindex.hml file in the root
 directory 'index.hml'

 References from the templates to the files should 
take this into account and point to the right file, 
of course.

 Maybe I am the only one who ran into this problem, 
maybe not.

 Hope you like the idea.

 Regards,
 Thomas
